\chapter{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to explain and demonstrate the syntax
and semantics of the Fermilab Hierarchical Configuration Language,
\fhicl%
\footnote{%
  The customary pronounciation is /fIkl/.%
}, so that users may become comfortable with its features and intended
use.

The end product of many years of experience with other configuration
languages and notation, \fhicl has been carefully designed to allow
its users to express, record, and retrieve sets of software parameters
used to \term{configure} (prepare for a particular purpose) a
program's execution.  We will use the term \term{parameter set} to
denote any specific collection of named values accessible to a user's
program while it is running; a \fhicl \term{document} is a textual
representation of such a parameter set.  Two or more \fhicl documents
are said to be \term{equivalent} if they lead to identical parameter
sets.

Depending on the programming language used to write the user program,
one of several software subsystems is used to produce a parameter set
from a given \fhicl document.  Each such subsystem is known as a
\term{binding} of the \fhicl specification to the programming
language, and provides for the analysis and interpretation of \fhicl
documents.

While it is up to each binding to specify how users interface to the
parameter sets produced by that binding, it is fundamental that users
be able to query a parameter set by providing it a name (in the form
of a string) in order to obtain the value corresponding to that name.
Further, a parameter set must be capable of producing a document that
is equivalent to the original document that gave rise to that
parameter set.


\chapter{Documents}

\section{Text}

A \fhicl document is simply a sequence of characters (\ie text),
structured as described below, and is commonly stored in a file whose
name is conventionally suffixed \fclcode{.fcl}.  For example,
\fclcode{my_config.fcl} might be the name of such a file.  Any
conventional text editor (\eg emacs, vi, nedit, \ldots) may be used to
create or to update a \fhicl file.%
\footnote{%
  Note that \fhicl documents need not be represented via any file.  A
  binding may, for example, obtain a \fhicl document from a database,
  via a string in a conventional programming language, or via any
  other mechanism that can denote simple text.  A binding is free to
  support an arbitrary number of document sources.%
}

\section{Name-value pairs}

A document consists principally of \term{name-value pairs}.%
\footnote{%
  A name-value pair is sometimes known as an \term{association},
  because parameter set lookup is designed to take a name and retrieve
  the associated value.  In this Guide we will usually prefer the
  simpler \term{pair} nomenclature.%
} There may be as many or as few such pairs as desired.%
\footnote{%
  A document consisting of no name-value pairs is said to be
  \term{empty}, as is the parameter set that a binding would generate
  from such a document.%
} In each pair, a colon (\verb|:|) separates the \term{name} from the
corresponding \term{value}.

At least one blank, tab, or newline character (collectively known as
\term{whitespace}) must separate one pair from the next.  The
following document, consisting of three name-value pairs, uses the
minimum required whitespace: 
\Needspace{.17in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
n:1 pi:3.14159 label:"horizontal axis"
\end{fcllisting}

\section{Optional whitespace}

Within a \fhicl document, additional whitespace may be used at the
discretion of the author.%
\footnote{%
  Such optional whitespace is commonly used to produce indentation or
  alignment.%
} A binding will ignore any such optional whitespace while producing a
parameter set from the document.

The following document is equivalent to the single-line document shown
above.  Consisting of the same three name-value pairs, this variation
employs extra whitespace to improve readability by (a) placing each
pair on an individual line and (b) aligning the values:
%
\Needspace{0.5in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
n     : 1
pi    : 3.14159
label : "horizontal axis"
\end{fcllisting}

\section{Preview of other features}

In addition to name-value pairs, a \fhicl document may contain
\term{comments} (commonly also known as \term{remarks} or
\term{annotations}) as well as \term{prolog} sections.  Further, a
document's contents may be spread over several files via the \fhicl
\term{include} mechanism.  Each of these features will be introduced
in this Guide.  We will also provide more details about \fhicl{}'s
names and values.


\chapter{Comments}

Document providers often wish to annotate the document's contents.
For example, it is common to provide a provenance giving the original
author's name and date, followed by a revision history.  Other
annotations include introductory overviews for each section of a
document, or even brief descriptions of individual name-value pairs.

\fhicl provides two ways to \term{introduce} (start) a comment:
\begin{itemize}
\item With a single \fclcode{#} character,%
  \footnote{%
    This notation is adopted from such scripting languages as bash,
    perl, and python.  The introductory \fclcode{#} character is known
    variously as a \term{pound sign}, \term{hash mark}, \term{sharp},
    or \term{octothorpe}%
    .}  or else
\item With two consecutive forward slashes (\fclcode{//}).\footnote{%
    This notation is adopted from such programming languages as BCPL
    and \cpp{}%
    .}
\end{itemize}
Either or both of these comment introductions may be used within any
\fhicl document.

The remainder of the line is the \term{body} of the comment, and
provides whatever information the author may desire.  The comment
implicitly terminates at the end of the line, although an author may
choose to continue his annotation onto any number of additional
comments on subsequent lines.

The following document illustrates the various forms that a \fhicl
comment may take.
%
\Needspace{0.67in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
# This is a comment
// This is also a comment
foo  : "bar"   # this is a comment "in the margin" ...
foo2 : "bar2" // ... and so is this
\end{fcllisting}

\chapter{Names}

\section{Spelling}

The spelling rules for \fhicl names match the spelling rules for
identifiers in many programming languages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each name begins with a letter or with a \fclcode{_}
  (underscore) character.
\item The name may be spelled with as many additional consecutive
  letters, underscores, or digits as desired.  No other characters
  (\eg punctuation or whitespace) may be embedded within a name.
\item Capitalization matters: the name \fclcode{X} is not the same
  name as the uncapitalized name \fclcode{x}.  Similarly, \fhicl
  treats the names \fclcode{Hello}, \fclcode{HELLO}, and
  \fclcode{hello} as three distinct, unrelated names.
\end{itemize}%

\section{Name reuse}

Consider the following document, noting especially the reuse of the
name \fclcode{a}.  When a binding processes this document, how many
name-value pairs will the resulting parameter set contain?
%
\Needspace{0.5in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
a : 1
b : 2
a : 3
\end{fcllisting}
%
The answer is two.  \fhicl provides that, if a document has two
name-value pairs that have a name in common, the value in the later
pair \term{overrides} (supercedes) the earlier one.\footnote{%
  If more than two pairs have a name in common, the second pair
  overrides the first as described above until the third such pair is
  encountered.  Then the third pair overrides the second until a
  fourth pair is encountered, and so on.  In this way, the last pair
  using that name will ultimately override all the earlier ones with
  the same name.%
} Therefore, in the above example, when \fclcode{a} is looked up in
the parameter set, the associated value will be found to be
\fclcode{3}.

\section{References}

Within some documents, a common scenario is to require that two (or
more) name-value pairs with distinct names nonetheless provide the
same value.  The most obvious approach is simply to duplicate the
value in each pair:
%
\Needspace{0.34in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
m : 1
n : 1
\end{fcllisting}
%
However, as is true when writing programs, such duplication becomes
problematic over time because it is not obvious by inspection that
these two values are intended always to be identical.  As a result, if
a future update were to change the value associated with \fclcode{m},
the required corresponding change to \fclcode{n} could be easily
overlooked, especially if there were a great many intervening lines.

To help avoid such an unhappy scenario, \fhicl allows a value to refer
to a previously-provided value: 
%
\Needspace{0.34in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
m : 1
n : @local::m
\end{fcllisting}
%
A construction such as \fclcode{@local::m} is known as a \fhicl
\term{reference}.  Each reference consists of the prefix
\fclcode{@local::} followed by a name (here, \fclcode{m}) from an
earlier name-value pair.%
\footnote{%
  The binding will report an error during processing if the name
  hasn't yet been seen.%
}

When a binding processes such a reference, the name is looked up among
the name-value pairs processed so far, and the corresponding value
\term{substituted} (used in place of the reference).  The value used
for the substitution is the value associated with the name at the time
the reference is parsed.  As a result, future revisions of the
configuration file which contain modifications to the value of the
first will automatically be propagated to the second, and the two
pairs will remain in sync.

In a single document, if the referenced name is given a new value,
that new value will be used for subsequent references; previously
processed references will not assume the new value.

\chapter{Values}

%\section{Classifications}
%
%At a high level,
%each \fhicl value can be classified
%as either \term{atomic} or \term{structured}.
%An \term{atom} (atomic value)
%is either
%  a \term{nil},
%  a \term{boolean},
%  a \term{number},
%or
%  a \term{string},
%while a structured value is either
%  a \term{complex} number,
%  a \term{sequence},
%or
%  a \term{table}.
%Each of these is further described in the following sections.

\section{Nil value}

The literal \fclcode{@nil}
serves as a placeholder value,
distinct from all other \fhicl values.
It is suitable for constructing a name-value pair
when no other \fhicl value will do.
%
\Needspace{0.17in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
higgs : @nil
\end{fcllisting}

\section{Boolean values}

The literals \fclcode{true} and \fclcode{false} correspond to the
customary truth values.  
%
\Needspace{0.17in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
debug : true
\end{fcllisting}

\section{Numeric values}
%
%\subsection{Form}

As in most programming languages, a \fhicl number can have up to four
parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \term{sign} part consists of a single \fclcode{+} or
  \fclcode{-} character,
\item The \term{whole} part consists of a non-empty sequence of
  digits, such as \fclcode{0} or \fclcode{123}; any extraneous leading
  zeroes will be ignored by the binding.
\item The \term{fraction} part consists of a single \fclcode{.}
  character followed by a possibly empty sequence of digits; any
  extraneous trailing zeroes will be ignored by the binding.
\item The \term{exponent} part consists of a single \fclcode{e} or
  \fclcode{E} character, optionally followed by a sign, followed by a
  non-empty sequence of digits.  Examples include \fclcode{E5} and
  \fclcode{e-23}.
\end{itemize}
All parts are optional, but there must be at least one digit in either
the whole or the fraction part.

In addition to the above, \fhicl treats the literal \fclcode{infinity}
as a number.  A sign may optionally precede this literal.
%
%\subsection{Interpretation}
%
%Although the nomenclature varies,
%programming languages typically distinguish
%among real values, unsigned integer values, and signed integer values.
%To the extent possible
%in the underlying programming language,
%each \fhicl binding
%must, without error, interpret each \fhicl number:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item as any kind of real value upon request;
%  \item as an unsigned integer value upon request
%        if the number can be equivalently rewritten
%        using no more than seven digits;
%  and
%  \item as a signed integer value upon request
%        if the number can be equivalently rewritten
%        using only an optional \fclcode{-} sign
%        followed by no more than seven digits.
%\end{itemize}
\Needspace{0.67in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
pi : 3.1415926
x  : 1.23e2
y  : -.45600e+3
z  : -infinity
\end{fcllisting}

A binding must take into account the mathematical value being
represented as well as any constraints imposed by the underlying
programming language.

\section{Complex values}

A \fhicl complex value is written as two numbers separated by a comma
and surrounded by parentheses:
% 
\Needspace{0.34in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
c1: (1, 2)
c2: (1.23, -3.1415926)
\end{fcllisting}
%
Whitespace before and after each number is optional.

\section{String values}

A \fhicl string is written as a sequence of characters usually
enclosed within matching quotation marks.  The quotation marks may be
omitted, but only if the string contains no whitespace, punctuation,
or other special characters: 
%
\Needspace{1.17in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
s1: a
s2: ab
s3: string
s4: "string"
s5: 'string'
s6: "123abc"
s7: '123abc'
\end{fcllisting}

If the string is double-quoted, \term{escaped characters} will be
interpreted as follows: \fclcode{\\n} as a newline character,
\fclcode{\\t} as a tab, \fclcode{\\'} as an apostrophe, \fclcode{\\"}
as a double-quote, and \fclcode{\\\\} as a (single)
backslash.\footnote{%
  The binding will produce a diagnostic for any other escaped
  characters.%
} If the string is single-quoted, all characters are taken verbatim;
escaped characters have no special meaning.

\section{Sequence values}

A \fhicl sequence starts with a left bracket and ends with a right
bracket.  These brackets surround a comma-separated list consisting of
an arbitrary number of \fhicl values.  Whitespace before and after
each value is optional; thus, the following three sequences are
considered identical.  
%
\Needspace{1.67in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
q1: [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
q2: [ 1, 2
    , 3, 4
    ]
q3: [
      1,
      2,
      3,
      4
    ]
\end{fcllisting}

Note that \fhicl sequences may be \term{heterogeneous}; that is, the
\term{elements} (values in a sequence) may be classified differently
from each other.  For example, some may be numbers while others are
not: 
%
\Needspace{0.50in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
q4: [ 1, (2, 3.14), "a b", @nil, true ]  # 5 elements
q5: [ ]                                 # 0 elements (empty)
q6: [ @local::q4, @local::q5 ]          # 2 elements
\end{fcllisting}
However, any given binding can support such heterogeneity only to the
extent that the underlying programming language supports
it.\footnote{%
  This is rarely a restriction because, in practice, sequences tend
  overwhelmingly to be \term{homogeneous}.%
}

Individual elements may be identified (in a reference, for example)
via a zero-based \term{subscript} (also known as an \term{index})
notation:
%
\Needspace{0.50in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
const: [ 2.7182818, 3.1415926 ]
e    : @local::const[0]
pi   : @local::const[1]
\end{fcllisting}
The same notation can be used to override an element, or even to
extend a sequence with an additional element\footnote{%
  \fhicl sequences are \term{dense}: if a sequence contains $n$
  elements, their respective subscripts are always $0, 1, \ldots,
  n-1$.  Extending a sequence will implicitly insert \fclcode{@nil} values, if
  needed, to preserve this property.  }: 
%
\Needspace{0.50in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
fib: [ 0, 1, 1, oops, 3, 5 ]  # 6 elements; heterogeneous
fib[3] : 2                    # now a homogeneous sequence
fib[6] : 8                    # now 7 elements
fib[8] : 21                   # now 9 elements (2nd-last is @nil)
\end{fcllisting}

\section{Table values}

A \fhicl table starts with a left brace and ends with a right brace.
Much like a document, the body of a \fhicl table consists of
name-value pairs.  Unlike a document, a \fhicl table can't have a
prolog.  The following document, for example, consists of a single
name-value pair whose value is a table consisting of three pairs:
%
\Needspace{0.67in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
t : {  a : 5
       b : 6
       c : 7
    }
\end{fcllisting}

Individual entries within a table may be identified using a
\term{member} notation.  For example, continuing the previous example
document: 
\Needspace{0.17in}
%
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
x : @local::t.c  # x's associated value is 7
\end{fcllisting}
%
The same notation can be used to override one of a table's values,
or even to \term{inject} an additional pair into a table:
\Needspace{0.34in}
%
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
t.b : hi    # b's associated value is overridden with "hi"
t.d : 3.14  # table now gains a fourth pair
\end{fcllisting}


\chapter{Includes}

To deal with complexity, it may be desirable to assemble a larger
\fhicl document from several smaller parts, with each fragment
contained in its own file.  Such assembly is made possible via
\fhicl's \fclcode{#include} directive.

The syntax for the directive is very strict in order to avoid possible
confusion with a \fclcode{#}-introduced comment: each
\fclcode{#include} is on a line by itself, with the \fclcode{#} in the
first column.  There must be exactly one space following
\fclcode{#include}, and then a double-quoted string identifying the
file name\footnote{%
  It has become conventional to identify such files with the suffix
  \fclcode{.fcl}.%
} of the target \fhicl document fragment.  
%
\Needspace{0.34in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
#include "filename1.fcl"
#include "/path/to/filename2.fcl"
\end{fcllisting}

A document may be composed of as many such directives as desired.  The
binding will replace each directive with the document fragment
contained in the corresponding named file.\footnote{%
  If it is set, the environment variable \fclcode{FHICL_INCLUDE_PATH}
  is consulted by the binding to locate a file so named.  The value of
  this variable is the usual colon-separated paths typified by the
  bash standard \fclcode{PATH} variable.%
} A fragment may itself contain \fclcode{#include}
directives.\footnote{%
  However, no fragment may include itself, even indirectly.%
} Although such directives are most commonly found at the start of a
document, they may appear wherever a user finds convenient.


\chapter{Prologs}

The purpose of a \fhicl \term{prolog} (also known as a \term{prolog
  section}) is to provide name-value pairs that can be referenced
later in the document.  Indeed, pairs within a prolog will not appear
in a parameter set unless they are thusly referenced outside the
prolog.

A common use for a prolog is to provide alternative values from which
to choose.  The following document uses a prolog in this fashion such
that only the 3-element sequence will appear in the parameter set:
%
\Needspace{0.84in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
BEGIN_PROLOG
  opt1: [0, 1, 2]
  opt2: [10, 11, 12, 13]
END_PROLOG
param: @local::opt1
\end{fcllisting}
%
The parameter set produced from the above document is
indistinguishable from that produced from: 
%
\Needspace{0.17in}
\begin{fcllisting}[texcl,escapechar=`]
param: [0, 1, 2]
\end{fcllisting}

A document may contain as many or as few prolog sections as desired,
so long as each starts with \fclcode{BEGIN_PROLOG} and ends with
\fclcode{END_PROLOG}.  No prolog may encompass another prolog; if
there is more than one, they must appear strictly sequentially.  Only
comments may precede a prolog section; no prolog sections are
permitted after a non-prolog name-value pair has appeared in the
document.

It is not possible to override a prolog's name-value pair from outside
a prolog.  Pairs outside a prolog that appear to override a prolog
pair are treated instead as new associations.
